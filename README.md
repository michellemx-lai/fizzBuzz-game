# FizzBuzz

This program allows user to play an interactive game called "FizzBuzz"

Fizzbuzz is a fun game played generally by school children. It is simple game in which when your turn comes, you need to say the next number. This game is now a classic programming example in the computer science world, and works as follows: several people get in a circle and count off numbers sequentially (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). Before counting, two numbers are selected: a “Fizz” number (let’s call it _f_) and a “Buzz” number (let’s call it _b_). When counting off, the player must say “Fizz” for numbers divisible by _f_ and “Buzz” for numbers divisible by b. Numbers divisible by both _f _and _b_ must be substituted with “FizzBuzz”. The game goes around the circle until someone messes up.

My program gets values _f_ and _b_ from the user, and then prints out numbers substituting “Fizz”, “Buzz”’, and “FizzBuzz” as described above. The user also gets to pick the numbers at which to start and end counting. The program quits when either f or b is zero.

Here is a summary of the rules of the game:
1. If number is divisible by any integer, say 3, then you need to say Fizz
2. If number is divisible by any integer, 5, then you need to say Buzz
3. If number is divisible by those integers (i.e. divisible by both 3 and 5), then you need to say FizzBuzz
4. Else you just need to say the next integer

The key takeaway from this short project is the application of for-loops and while-loops in Java, as well as reading and storing user input. Many of the outputs are printed in tabular format to enhance user experience.
