# FizzBuzz

This program allows user to play an interactive game called "FizzBuzz"

Fizzbuzz is a fun game played generally by school children. It is simple game in which when your turn comes, you need to say the next number. Here are rules of the game:

1. If number is divisible by 3, then you need to say Fizz
2. If number is divisible by 5, then you need to say Buzz
3. If number is divisible by 3 and 5 both, then you need to say FizzBuzz
4. Else you just need to say next number

The key takeaway from this short project is the application of for-loops and while-loops in Java. Many of the outputs are printed in tabular format to enhance user experience.
